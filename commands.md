# bash activate conda environment
without this, I usually get an error that my shell isn't equipped to activate a conda environment
```
~ source ~/.bashrc
~ conda activate news
```

# start hosting the newsapi call
```
~ python app.py
```

# llama.cpp
```
./main -m tmp/llama-2-7b-chat.Q3_K_L.gguf -p "Starting prompt that it'll just spit out to heart's content"
```
