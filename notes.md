[Rosser 2007] should be a good source for an outline of complexity theory. 

- V claims work in Computational Complexity Theory crucially involves "easy and fast verification of a proposed result or theorem," "the speed of convergence," "the nature of the growth of functions," and the "subtle and nuanced differences between deriving a theorem and verifying its truth value."
- Issue of Approximation: (yes in comp. comp. theory but not in alg. comp. theory) distinction between theories of exact and numerical-analysis-type approximations never made explicit ? 
- Variations to computational complexity theory include algorithmic complexity theory, diophantine complexity theory (remarks in chapter 7 of [Velupillai 2000]), topological complexity theory, etc., each of which are based on a formal model of computation. 
- V convinced algorithmic complexity theory should not adorn itself with the word "complexity."
